# Rust Basics

## Variables

Default variables are immutable
Use `mut` to make a variable mutable

```rust
let x = 5; // immutable
let mut y = 10; // mutable
```

### Constants

Constants are always immutable and must have a type annotation.

```rust
const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
```

Can be declared in any scope, including global scope.

Constants must be set to a constant expression,
which means they cannot be set to the result of a function call or a variable.

They can only be set to a value that can be determined at compile time.

* Convention: `SNAKE_CASE` for constants

### Shadowing

Declaring a new variable with the same name as a previous variable.
_The first variable is shadowed by the second_

Second variable overshadows the first variable until the end of the scope,
or until the second variable is shadowed by another variable.

```rust
fn main() {
  let x = 5;
  let x = x + 1; // shadowing, x is now 6
  {
    let x = x * 2; // shadowing
    println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {}", x); // 12
  }
  println!("The value of x in the outer scope is: {}", x); // 6
}
```

We are effectively creating a new variable with the same name

The new variable can have a different type than the previous variable,
or it can be mutable while the previous variable was immutable.

#### Use Cases for Shadowing

1. Allowing you to change the type of a variable or to make an immutable variable mutable.
2. Avoiding the need for a new name for a variable when you want to change its value.
w.g., when you want to convert a string to a number, you can shadow the string variable with a new variable that has the number type.

```rust
let mut guess = String::new(); // Mutable string variable
io::stdin()
  .read_line(&mut guess)
  .expect("Failed to read line");

let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse().expect("Enter a number"); // Shadowing the string variable with a new variable of type u32
```

## Data Types

* Rust is a statically typed language, meaning that the type of a variable must be known at compile time.

Data types can be inferred by the compiler, so you don't always need to annotate them.

### Scalar Types

Single value types

4 main scalar types:

1. Integers
2. Floating-point numbers
3. Booleans
4. Characters

#### Integers

A number without a fractional component.

| Length | Signed | Unsigned |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 8-bit | `i8` | `u8` |
| 16-bit | `i16` | `u16` |
| 32-bit | `i32` | `u32` |
| 64-bit | `i64` | `u64` |
| 128-bit | `i128` | `u128` |
| arch | `isize` | `usize` |

* Signed variant can store numbers from `-(2^(n-1))` to `2^(n-1) - 1`
* Unsigned variants can store numbers from `0` to `2^n - 1`

`isize` and `usize` are pointer-sized integers, meaning they are the same size as a pointer on the current architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).

Integer literals can be expressed in different formats:

| Number literals | Example      |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Decimal         | 98_222      |
| Hex             | 0xff        |
| Octal           | 0o77        |
| Binary          | 0b1111_0000 |
| Byte (`u8` only)  | b'A'        |

> Integer Overflow:
>
> When compiling for `--debug` mode, Rust will panic on integer overflow.
>
> When compiling for `--release` mode, Rust will wrap around the value, using two's complement representation.

#### Floating-point numbers

2 main types:

1. `f32` - 32-bit floating point
2. `f64` - 64-bit floating point (default)

```rust
fn main() {
  let x = 2.0; // f64

  let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
```

Represented using IEEE-754 standard.

#### Boolean

1. `true`
2. `false`

#### Character

```rust
fn main() {
  let c = 'z'; // char
  let z: char = 'Z'; // char
  let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»'; // Unicode character
}
```

4 bytes in size, representing a single Unicode scalar value.
Single quotes are used for characters, while double quotes are used for strings.

### Compound Types

Multiple values in a single type.

#### Tuples

General way of grouping together a number of values with different types.

Fixed length, once declared, the length cannot change.

```rust
fn main() {
  let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
  let (x, y, z) = tup; // destructuring
  println!("The value of y is: {}", y); // 6.4
}
```

To access a tuple element, use a period followed by the index of the element:

```rust
fn main() {
  let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
  println!("The value of the first element is: {}", tup.0); // 500
  println!("The value of the second element is: {}", tup.1); // 6.4
  println!("The value of the third element is: {}", tup.2); // 1
}
```

#### Arrays

Every element must have the same type, and the length is fixed.

```rust
fn main() {
  let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // array of integers
  let b: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // array with type annotation
  println!("The first element of a is: {}", a[0]); // 1
}
```

Data is stored on the stack, unlike vectors which are stored on the heap.

```rust
fn main() {
  let months = [
    "January", "February", "March", "April", "May",
    "June", "July", "August", "September", "October",
    "November", "December"
  ]; // array of strings
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
  let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // array with type annotation
  let b = [3; 5]; // array with all elements initialized to 3
  let c: [i32; 5] = [0; 5]; // array with type annotation with all elements initialized to 0
}
```

> Accessing an element outside the bounds of the array will cause a panic at runtime.

## Functions

* Convention: `snake_case` for function names

### Parameters

Requires type annotations for parameters.

Multiple parameters are separated by commas.

```rust
fn main() {
  let x = 5;
  let y = 10;
  add(x, y);
}

fn add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
  println!("The sum of {} and {} is: {}", x, y, x + y);
}
```

### Statements

Statements do not return a value, they are executed for their side effects.

Every statement ends with a semicolon (`;`).

```rust
fn main() {
  let x = 5; // statement
  let y = 10; // statement

  let z = (let w = 20); // Error, because `let` is a statement, not an expression. Does not return a value.
}
```

### Expressions

Expressions evaluate to a value and can be used in statements.
They return a value.

Must not end with a semicolon (`;`), otherwise they will be treated as statements.

```rust
fn main() {
  let x = 5; // statement
  let y = {
    let z = 10; // expression
    z + 1 // expression, returns a value
  };
  println!("The value of y is: {}", y); // 11
}
```

### Return Values

Type annotations are required for return values.

`->` operator is used to specify the return type of a function.

```rust
fn main() {
  let x = add(5, 10);
  println!("The sum of 5 and 10 is: {}", x); // 15
}

fn add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
  x + y // expression, returns a value
}
```

The `return` statement is optional, the last expression in a function is the return value.
It can be used to return early from a function.

Must not end with a semicolon (`;`), otherwise it will be treated as a statement.

* Multiple return values can be returned using tuples.

## Comments

Use `//` for single-line comments and `/* */` for multi-line comments.

```rust
fn main() {
  // This is a single-line comment
  let x = 5; // This is an inline comment
  println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
  /* This is a
  * multi-line comment
  * that spans multiple lines */
  println!("This is a multi-line comment example");
}
```

## Control Flow

### `if` Expressions

```rust
fn main() {
  let number = 6;
  if number % 4 == 0 {
    println!("Number is divisible by 4");
  } else if number % 3 == 0 {
    println!("Number is divisible by 3");
  } else {
    println!("Number is not divisible by 4 or 3");
  }
}
```

`if` expressions expect a boolean value

```rust
fn main() {
  let number = 6;
  if number {
    println!("This will not compile, because `number` is not a boolean");
  }
}
```

#### `if` in `let` Statements

`if` is an expression, meaning it returns a value.

```rust
fn main() {
  let number = 6;
  let result = if number % 2 == 0 {
    "even"
  } else {
    "odd"
  };
  println!("The number is: {}", result); // The number is: even
}
```

All arms must return the same type

```rust
fn main() {
  let number = 6;
  let result = if number % 2 == 0 {
    "even"
  } else {
    1 // Error, because the first branch returns a string and the second branch returns an integer
  };
}
```

### Loops

#### `loop`

Basic loop that runs indefinitely until explicitly broken out of.

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut counter = 0;
  loop {
    counter += 1;
    println!("Counter: {}", counter);
  }
}
```

Use `break` to exit the loop.

> Basically just a `while true` loop.

#### Returning Values from Loops

`break` can be used like a `return` statement to return a value from the loop.

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut counter = 0;
  let result = loop {
    counter += 1;
    if counter == 5 {
      break counter * 2; // Returns 10 when the loop ends
    }
  };
  println!("The result is: {}", result); // The result is: 10
}
```

`return` can also be used to return a value from a loop, but it also exits the function.

`break` and `continue` only acts on the innermost loop.

To act upon an outer loop, labels can be used.

* Labels are defined with an apostrophe (`'`) followed by a name.

```rust

fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    'counting_up: loop {
        println!("count = {count}");
        let mut remaining = 10;

        loop {
            println!("remaining = {remaining}");
            if remaining == 9 {
                break;
            }
            if count == 2 {
                break 'counting_up;
            }
            remaining -= 1;
        }

        count += 1;
    }
    println!("End count = {count}");
}
```

### `while`

Loop that runs while a condition is true.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;
    while number != 0 {
        println!("{number}!");
        number -= 1;
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

### `for`

Loop that iterates over a collection or a range.

Simplifies:

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    let mut index = 0;

    while index < 5 {
        println!("the value is: {}", a[index]);

        index += 1;
    }
}
```

To:

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a {
        println!("the value is: {element}");
    }
}
```

[LIFTOFF while loop](#while)

```rust
fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{number}!");
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```
